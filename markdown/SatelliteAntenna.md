## Overview
> Really fun Antenna made during the bootcamp of our major to retreive data of a dead satellite to get images of earth using a stick (sorry I meant **THE STICK** that we meticulously chose) and metal wire.

## Process

To capture the correct wavelength, the wire needed to be a specific length and set at a specific angle ours was 120. We followed this schematic:

First we tried to retreive data from the radio and succeeded !

Then, we tracked down old weather satellites that transmit real-time images of Earth via radio signals.
Here is a picture captured with our antenna from a NOAA satellite, which, when decoded, provides us with an image.

And this is our final attempt !

## Cricket experiment

A friend and I played around a bit with electronics and nature to simulate the sound of a cricket. Attempting to blend nature and electronics.
