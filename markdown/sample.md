Welcome to my portfolio! I am Maïli Truong and I am currently in forth year of engineering school in Paris. More precisely, I am in a Creative Technologies' Master at ESILV (École Supérieure Léonard de Vinci). In this Master I am in the Human Learning Research group of the school, where my goal will be to innovate around human machine interaction and explore its impact on human's psychology and memory. In this portfolio you will follow my learning process to achieve this goal driven by a huge curiosity for technologies, for the world in general and the love of learning.
