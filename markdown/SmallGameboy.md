## Overview
> Making a small game boy, learning how to design the PCB to solderingeach of the electronic components to finally making a networked multiplayer game implemented for ESP-based devices. The game is a variation of the game of Nim in a shape of a rotating flower.

Here is my first attempt at learning Kicad designing a counter:

## FlowerGame

A variation of the game of Nim as a networked multiplayer game implemented for ESP-based devices in a flower shape, where the players take turns to remove one, two or three petals until none are left. The looser is the player picking the last petal. This project uses the ESP32 microcontroller and a small OLED display for interactive gameplay.

- **Game rules**

## Features

- You can either join or host a party (via WIFI access point).
- OLED Display interaction.
- You can rotate the flower and choose which petal to pick.
- The updates are made in real-time.
- You can control via a 3x3 keypad matrix.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MailiTruong/FlowerGame.git   
    cd FlowerGame
    ```

2. Ensure your ESP32 board is properly connected and recognized by your system.

3. Modify the **Sketch.yaml** file to specify your board’s FQBN and port if necessary.

4. Compile and upload the code to both Host and Guest ESP32 devices.

## Usage

1. **Setting Up the Game**:
    - On each ESP32 device, after uploading, start the game by selecting whether the player **hosts** or **joins** the party.
    - **Host**: This device will create a Wi-Fi access point and broadcast a session code.
    - **Guest**: This device will connect to the host’s network using the provided session code.

2. **Playing the Game**:
    - Use the keypad to interact with the game. Key controls:
        - **Left** and **Right**: Rotate through flower petals.
        - **Down**: Remove the selected petal.
        - **A**: Switch turns.
    - The game ends when the last petal is removed, displaying the winner on each screen.

## Code Overview

- `Game.hpp` / `Game.cpp`: Core game logic and functions for initializing the game, updating the display, and handling player actions.
- `Host.hpp` / `Host.cpp`: Host-specific functionality, including Wi-Fi AP setup.
- `Guest.hpp` / `Guest.cpp`: Guest-specific functionality, including connecting to the host’s Wi-Fi.
- `flower_arduino.ino`: Main Arduino sketch handling setup and game initialization.
